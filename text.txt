President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden held an actual debate on Thursday night in Nashville, Tennessee -- the final time the two candidates will share the stage before the November 3 election.

Unlike their first debate last month, the two candidates actually engaged one another (generally speaking) on issues, led skillfully by debate moderator Kristen Welker.
Below, the best and worst of the night that was.
